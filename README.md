# Redux learning

## Theory

**Redux** - js library for managing application state

- Database for frontend
- Centralizes application state
- Makes data flow transparent and predictable

**Reducer** - pure function

**Action** - js object that describes what just happened

## Start

1. `json-server` --watch db.json
2. `npm start`

## ToDo

- write tests for all code
- make new branch for UI work
